      <h2>Manipulate Font Size</h2>	 
      <p>One size does not fit all. This control allows the user to enlarge or reduce the font size without affecting the layout of the page. Giving users this option makes your website user-friendly, because it improves on readibility and it gives the user the power of deciding what works for them.  </p>

      <h2>Dark mode or Light Mode</h2>
      <p>There a lot of reasons why people prefer one over the other one. Some people with vision problems might prefer dark mode and some other 
            believe that light mode is better for proof reading tasks because of its positive contrast polarity. Personally, I enjoy everything in dark mode. 
      Specially when I'm coding late at night or really early in the morning. Whatever the reason, I love the idea of letting the user choose what is better for them.  </p>

      <h2>Change Font Type</h2>
      <p>For this example I used 3 types of font style Serif, Sans Serif, and Monospace. Serifs are the fonts with little hooks. The most common one that everyone knows is Times New Roman. 
            Serifs are a harder to read online and work better for printed materials. Sans Serif means no "serifs". These are the fonts without the little hooks and sans serifs are widely used online for most
      most websites. Popular Sans serifs fonts are Arial, Geneva, Helvetica, Verdana, etc. Lastly, we have the monospace fonts. Programmers are very familiar with this type of fonts and if you have everyone
      dabbled with command prompt then you know what this type of font looks like. Monospace fonts have the same width for each character like typewritters. The most known monospace font is courier. 
      There are other types of fonts that I did not use for this projects, they are Fantasy/Display fonts and handwritting fonts</p>
