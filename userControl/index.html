      <h2>Manipulate Font Size</h2>	 
      <p>One size does not fit all. This control allows the user to enlarge or reduce the font size without affecting the layout of the page. Giving users this option makes your website user-friendly, because it improves on readibility and it gives the user the power of deciding what works for them.  </p>

      <h2>Manipulate Font Size</h2>
      <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the  readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of  using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of  letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it  look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web  page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a  search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their  infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by  accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

      <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It  has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making  it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at  Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure  Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through  the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the  undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33  of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by  Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of  ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem  Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section  1.10.32.</p>
      <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is  reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33  from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in  their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914  translation by H. Rackham.</p>
    
      <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
      <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but  the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,  or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you  are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there  isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem  Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as  necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses  a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model  sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The  generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition,  injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>
